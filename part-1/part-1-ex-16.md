# Short overview

I took the devops-with-docker material from Docker Hub and deployed it to Azure

The application is running at:
```
devopswithdockermaterial.cyhwfca2czhja3gj.germanywestcentral.azurecontainer.io
```

The deployment was done following these steps directly from the Docker Hub, no Dockerfile required:
